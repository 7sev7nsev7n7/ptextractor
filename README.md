# Pony Town Skin Extractor

This utility serves to extract information from Pony Town .ptc files exported
from the game, allowing easier sharing of skin details.

This project is a work in progress

# Usage

(when they become available) download the latest release from the sidebar. run
the executable from the command line specifying the directory where your
character.ptc file is (note that this utility only works for single characters,
full lists will be added in future versions).

example:

```bash
ptextract ~/downloads/character.ptc
```
